# Dual-path network combining CNN and transformer for pavement crack segmentation 

The [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2023.105217) has been accepted by **Automation in Construction**ÔºÅ Main framework of the proposed network is as follows:

We have uploaded a model code implemented using **PyTorch**, which is simple and brief. And we also uploaded the [example weights]() trained on the [DeepCrack](https://github.com/yhlleo/DeepCrack) dataset, which can help us better experience the model's performance.

More details will be described in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2023.105217). If this work is helpful to you, or if you need to use our network in your work, please cite us:
